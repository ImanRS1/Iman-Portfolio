A portfolio website I created to showcase myself and my other projects, using carefully selected color themes and smooth animations pleasing to the eyes.

The website was created using React, JS (ES6), HTML5, SASS, animations with framer motion package, styled components and imported fontawesome icons. Parts of the project was inspired from a course held by Dev Ed.
